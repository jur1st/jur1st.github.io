<h3 id="what-you-realistically-need">What You Realistically Need</h3>

<p>In addition to your sous vide dingus want to make sure you have the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A large stock pot</li>
  <li>Quart and gallon sized Ziploc freezer bags</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, that’s all. Oh, you may also want to consder whether you have some safety pins or chip clips sitting around the house too. No, you don’t <em>need</em> a vacuum sealer machine. I’ve got one and every time I use it I come away fairly frustrated and often just give up and use a ziploc bag instead. No, you don’t need one of those very food-service looking plastic tubs. Using the supplies listed above I’ve made things as small as baby carrots to as large as a leg of lamb.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="which-sous-vide-dingus-should-i-buy">Which Sous Vide Dingus Should I Buy?</h3>

<p>I’ve got the Anova Bluetooth only model and it’s super. No, you don’t need to control the thing from your phone. Other than the whole “in a bag” part of this, sous vide is a lot like using a slow cooker. Turn it on, walk away, in a few hours your stuff will be ready. If you’re a half hour on this side or the other of the initial target time it’s no big deal. In fact, I only mention Bluetooth as a way to differntiate it from the one that has 812.11 wireless networking built into it. You’ll actually only interact with this thing via the start/stop button and the wheel that sets the temperature. The Joule takes this one step closer to insanity by being controlled only via a phone or iPad. That’s insane, I don’t care if it’s got a magnet on the bottom or not.</p>

<h3 id="how-big-is-this-thing">How Big is This Thing?</h3>

<p>It’s not exactly small. If you’ve got a stick/immersion blender it’s about as long as that probably is when it’s assembled.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-we-cook-first">What Should We Cook First?</h3>

<p>Go ahead and resign yourself to the idea that you’ll try to sous vide everything for the first month. I encourage this but you should set yourself up for success first. I recommend trying a pork tenderloin, chicken breasts, and carrots.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-steak">What About Steak?</h3>

<p>So here’s the thing about steaks. If you like steaks, you likely know how to cook a steak in a cast iron skillet with salt, clarified butter, and fresh thyme that’s as good as anything you’ll pay $100 for in Las Vegas. That also likely means you like you steak cooked rare. In my experience, you don’t achieve a whole heck of a lot from cooking a strip or a ribeye sous vide.</p>

<p>Now if you’re more of a medium rare kind of person or you’re cooking a big hunk of meat like a rib roast or a beef tenerloin where you want it to be warmed through but don’t want to risk that nasty overcooked grey ring then sous vide is the way to go. We’ve done a leg of lamb and it was great.</p>
